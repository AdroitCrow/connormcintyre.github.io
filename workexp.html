            Below I have listed some jobs and projects I have worked on over the last few years, as well as how they helped me become 
            a better programmer and employee. If you have any questions, please shoot me an email at <a class="email" href="mailto:mcintyrecg@cua.edu">mcintyrecg@cua.edu</a>.

            Shoe Saleman
          </p>
          <p>
            Summer 2021, '22, '23, '24, '25
          </p>
          <p>
            For the last 4 years, I have worked as a shoe salesman at a local small business in my hometown. 
            During work, I would greet customers, answer questions and give suggestions about what shoes would 
            fill customers' specific needs, handle phone calls and mail orders, and manage the register. I also 
            offered some tech support for my coworkers, as in the summer of '24, we had just switched to a new 
            POS system, and some of my coworkers had trouble adapting to the new online system. Working at the 
            store helped me develop and practice customer service skills, and has taught me quite a bit about 
            the differences between shoe brands. I also have found I pay much more attention to the shoes 
            people wear than I did before working there.

            Command-Line Calculator
          </p>
          <p>
            Fall 2025
          </p>
          <p>
            During the fall of my Sophomore year, I created a command-line calculator in Java capable of handling addition,
            subtraction, multiplication, division, and parenthesis. This project was completed with four of my classmates. We used a simple tree to parse 
             and re-write the initial input, and then calculated the answer of the resulting expression 
             using a series of Java objects. The project furthered my understanding of how trees in Java 
             work, and it helped me learn how to work in a group on a difficult coding assignment.

           Blender Animation
          </p>
          <p>
            Spring 2025
          </p>
          <p>
            In the spring of my sophomore year, I created a short animation in Blender using a real-world object I 
            scanned and converted into a mesh. I chose a Rubik's Cube due to its simple profile and scanned it 
            using an app called "Polycam" on my phone. This created a .obj file, which I imported into MeshLab
             and trimmed down until I had just the cube. I used Blender to fill in the hole underneath the cube 
             from the scan, and created a simple magic-themed animation in Blender, using mostly keyframes and a 
             short physics simulation. If you'd like to see the result, check it out here: <a class="email" href="https://youtu.be/za6NQJ-n_9A">https://youtu.be/za6NQJ-n_9A</a>
