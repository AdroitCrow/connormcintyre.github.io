            About
          </h3>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Connor, and I built this website using HTML and CSS during my spring semster in 2025. In this webpage I'd like to tell you
            a bit about myself. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I was raised in the realitvly small town of Traverse City, MI. I went to high school at Saint Francis High School, a small private catholic
            high school. While i was there, I discovered my passion for music, I deepened my faith, and I was first exposed to coding
            in my AP Computer Science class junior year. While there I was very involved, including 4 years of marching and concert band, 4 years of cross country, 4 years
            acting in the school musical, 3 years in track and feild, and one year in the school choir. I also formed a cover band with some friends my junior year, as the bassist.
            When applying for colleges, I applied to CUA as an Architecture major. I was accepted and began studying architecture as a freshman in 2023. However, 
            I soon discovered that Architecture was not my passion, and in the spring of 2024 I switched to
            Computer Science. While in college, I have been a member of the cornerstone scholars program, made the deans list every semester, and have become the co-captain of the pep band. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As for my personal interests and hobbys, I enjoy playing my bass and learning new instruments, going to concerts, playing video games,
            reading books, and running.
