            About
          </h3>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Connor, and I built this website using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript during my spring semester of college in 2025. On this web page, I'd like to tell you
            a bit about myself. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up in the relatively small town of Traverse City, MI. I went to high school at Saint Francis High School, a small private catholic
            high school. While I was there, I discovered my love for music, I deepened my faith, and I was first exposed to coding
            in my AP Computer Science class junior year. During high school, I was very involved, including 4 years of marching and concert band, 4 years of cross country, 4 years
            acting in the school musical, 3 years in track and field, and one year in the school choir. I also formed a cover band with some friends in my junior year, as the bassist.
            When applying for colleges, I applied to CUA as an Architecture major. I was accepted and began studying architecture as a freshman in 2023. However, 
            I soon discovered that Architecture was not my passion, and in the spring of 2024 I switched to
            Computer Science. While in college, I have been a member of the Cornerstone Scholars program, made the dean's list every semester, and was the co-captain of the pep band '24-25. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As for my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing my bass, learning new instruments, going to concerts, playing video games,
            reading books, and running. 
          </p>
          <p>
            During the summers, I work as a floor salesman at a shoe store, a local small business that is family-owned and operated.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am yet to work an internship, but I have one lined up for this summer, doing some freelance coding for my dad to help streamline
            one of his buisness ventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you'd like to get to know me better, feel free to check out my Instagram, or shoot me an email, and I'd be happy to chat!
